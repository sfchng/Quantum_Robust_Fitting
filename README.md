### About ###
This is the official repository for Quantum Robust Fitting.

### Getting Started ###
This demo runs in MATLAB, and has been tested on macOS Catalina and Ventura.

### Demo 1: 2D Line Fitting ###
This demo demonstrates an example of computing the ``exact influence`` on the 2D line fitting problem.
1. Run `main.m` in demo_influence folder.

### Demo 2: Homography Estimation ###
This demo demonstrates an example of computing the ``exact influence`` on solving a homography instance for 20 feature correspondences.
1. Run `main.m` in demo_homography_small folder.

### Demo 3: Large-Scale Homography Estimation ###
This demo demonstrates an example of computing the ``approximate influence`` on solving a large-scale homography instance for more than 200 feature correspondences.
1. Run `main.m` in demo_homography_large folder.


### Dependencies ###
- gurobi (https://www.gurobi.com) (optional)


### Reproducibility ###
We provide the results of large-scale homography estimation for a ``church`` instance. If you wish to plot the results, please follow the steps below:
1. Download the results from the following link:
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Z5Be2T78u2PQfWPL0_bl1uvUZlCfDMY?usp=sharing
   
   Please note that you will find two results at the provided link: `accv_official.zip` contains the influence corresponding to the results in the paper, and  `run2.zip` contains the influence for a recent run.
2. Place the data in `demo_homography_large/output` directory.
3. Run `evaluate_approx_influence.m`. You will then obtain the following plots,
